### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log.

Each commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements:

1. **type**: The type of change you're making. Common types include:

   - feat: A new feature
   - fix: A bug fix
   - docs: Documentation only changes
   - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
   - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - perf: A code change that improves performance
   - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

2. **scope**: An optional section that provides additional contextual information (e.g., component name, module name).

3. **description**: A short, imperative tense description of the change.

4. **body**: An optional longer description of the change.

5. **footer**: Optional section(s) for including issue references or breaking change notes.

Examples:

```
feat: add user authentication feature

fix(login): resolve issue with password reset functionality

docs: update README with new build instructions

style: format code according to style guide

refactor: restructure data processing pipeline for better efficiency

perf: optimize database queries for faster response times

test: add unit tests for user registration process

chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

Remember to:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter of the description
- No dot (.) at the end of the description
